## Description

- Clicker is an idle clicker game developed using Jquery from Javascript, CSS and HTML as a combination. In this game, you have to click a button to earn some money, which will be used to buy upgrades or even cursors that will auto-click on a certain timer. The goal is to be the richest guy around.

- At the start, each click gives you only $1, and you have to click a bit to buy the first upgrade: Increase on-click income, which gives you one more dollar each time you click.

- At some point you will be able to buy the second upgrade: Add cursor. This upgrade gives you the opportunity to add a cursor orbiting around the button. This same cursor auto-clicks on a certain timer and gives you points depending on its rank.

- This unlocks three more upgrades: Merge cursors, Upgrade cursor income and Upgrade cursor speed. The first one allows you to merge three cursors of the same level in order to create an even more powerful one. The second one is as simple as its name; it increases the value of each auto-click for all the cursors. The third one is a bit more complex; it does not speed up the cursors around the button but rather decreases the time between each auto-click.

- The last upgrade available is: Upgrade button. This last upgrade permits you to upgrade the whole clicker button into a more valuable one. It does not only changes the style of the button, it also increases the value of the said button. However, this upgrade will be really expensive at first and then will make all the others prices scale with it. It is more of a late-game upgrade.

- The progression will be stored in the localStorage of your browser.
